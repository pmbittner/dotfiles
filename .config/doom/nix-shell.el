;;; Commentary:
;;
;; nix-shell integration.  See: <URL:https://nixos.org/nix/manual/#sec-nix-shell>
;;
;; Usage:
;;
;; The main entry points are `nix-shell-activate', which queries the user for a
;; "shell.nix" path to activate, and `nix-shell-deactivate' to deactivate it.
;;
;; `nix-shell' will start a inferior `shell' with nix-shell.
