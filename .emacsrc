#### [ELISP ARGS FOR (DOOM) EMACS] ####
# I did not found an existing way to pass some elisp code to
# doom emacs that is run at startup.
# Hence, in the following, I implemented it myself.
# The idea is to have an (empty) elisp file.
# I called this file 'dynamic-args.el' and put it into my $DOOMDIR.
# My emacs config will run the code in this file, when emacs
# is started or whenever a new emacsclient connects.
# Hence, when I want emacs to run some elisp code right after
# initialization, I first write my code to the args file, and
# then start emacs.

# This variable points to the (initially empty) args file,
# which will be loaded dynamically at emacs startup, or whenever
# a client connects.

# However, due to a bug in dired, it exits emacs once we open a file.
# Also, I don't really dired and you can hate me for it.
